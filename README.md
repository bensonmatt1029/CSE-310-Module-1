# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continually expanding my understanding of C++ and its core concepts such as classes, functions, and the Standard Template Library (STL). To solidify these concepts, I developed a simple calculator application using C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations. My primary goal was to improve my proficiency in writing efficient, clean, and reusable code while integrating error handling and control structures.

This project allowed me to explore and practice several features of C++ like expressions, conditionals, loops, and data structures (specifically the map). Through this, I gained a deeper understanding of C++ syntax and how to use the languageâ€™s features to build practical applications.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio 2022 as my IDE. I used the language C++ for this project and I included the use of the Standard Library for managing data structures. In this project, I used the "map" to map arithmetic operators to functions.

# Future Work

-Implement advanced operations such as exponents and roots.
-Improve user input validation and error messages.
-Add a more user-friendly interface or even a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance usability.
